       <p> Hi my name is Taylor Hannon and I am an 18 year old college studnet. I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia and I am an intended Finance major. I am planning on applying to the Terry College of Business my first semester of sophmore year. Additionally I am in the Honors College at UGA and I am provided with many opportunities through this. Before the University of Georgia, I lived in Johns Creek, Georgia and I attended Chattahoochee High School. I was involved in track and cross country there and I also was a part of Class Council and multiple other organizations. </p> <p> I love being around my family and hanging out with my friends. I have a younger sister who is a junior in high school and we are extremely close. I also have a mom, dad and a dog named Puka. My entire extended family lives in Colorado and I have 11 cousins who range from the age of 8 to 26 years old. Below is a numbered list of all of my cousins. I am able to see my cousins at least once a year when my family visits Colorado for snow skiing over winter break. We also tend to have family reuinions every couple of years. I am blessed with such an amazing family and I especially miss my sister while I am at UGA. </p>

       <p> I enjoy being outside and being a part of team sports. All throughout grade schohol I participated in different sports such as soccer, tennis, lacross, track, cross coutnry and swim. Even thougth I am not able to do any of these sports in college, I still love to run outside and workout at the gym. I also love hiking and being on the lake. My family has a lake house that we go to all the time, and here I love tubing and wakeboarding. I am an extremely social person and love doing all of these activities with my friends and family. </p>
